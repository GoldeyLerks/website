-Ban evade;;

-Dispespectful in ticket
-Improper RP
-Grief

Beat BoxxyBooty  to death with a toolbox while they were in crit as a non-antag. reasons for this were "They stole my toolbox". The logs prove that they killed them whilst they were in crit, but they kept denying it even when I told them the logs showed they were lying. After this, he said "Well he never should have taken my toolbox" and disconnected. It has been over 10 mins since d/c as of writing this, so its not a crash.
