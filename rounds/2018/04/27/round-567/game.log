[00:22:04]SAY: Walrus23/(Jesus Kiefer) has made a priority announcement: You may be right that Ratatouille depicted kitchens accurately, but it had a lot of other problems that really broke my immersion. Okay, so you want to make a movie where rats have human level intelligence, and they understand English (French?), and one of them is a foodie and wants to be a chef. Fine, I can accept that premise. But then half way through the movie I’m also supposed to accept that this rat can have perfect fine motor control of a human being just by pulling on his scalp? No. Further, the movie is really insulting to the art and discipline of cooking good food. We’re supposed to believe that this untrained creature (doesn’t matter what species) can just show up into a kitchen, sprinkle a few extra ingredients into an already cooking soup, and make it amazing? That without any control over his ingredients, no prior practice, and no familiarity with his kitchen or staff, he can whip up amazing dishes that please the harshest critic? No. I get that he has passion for food. He may even have specia (120,126,2)
