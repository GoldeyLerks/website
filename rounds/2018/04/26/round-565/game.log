[22:37:58]SAY: Walrus23/(Jesus Kiefer) has made a priority announcement: The attack on Pearl Harbor was a surprise military strike conducted by the Imperial Japanese Navy against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on the morning of December 7, 1941 (December 8 in Japan). The attack led to the United States&#39; entry into World War II. The attack was intended as a preventive action in order to keep the U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with military actions the Empire of Japan was planning in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States. There were simultaneous Japanese attacks on the U.S.-held Philippines and on the British Empire in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong. The attack came as a profound shock to the American people and led directly to the American entry into World War II in both the Pacific and European theaters. The following day, December 8, the United States declared war on Japan. Domestic support for non-interventionism, which had been strong, disappeared. Clandestine support of Brita (120,126,2)

[22:49:53]SAY: Walrus23/(Jesus Kiefer) has made a priority announcement: A week ago I approached a woman on the street. She was 6/10. Kinda too much make up. But I thought I still had a chance to make love with her. I was very polite. But she still rejected me. I punched her and tried to rape her. She screamed for help and tried to fight back. And some random guy came and knocked me out of my counciousness. I didnt have sex that night and I stayed virgin. What I want to say that it is by far more harmful to say no than getting raped. When you get raped you might actually enjoy it. But if you say no to a nice guy, the guys self-esteem is completely destroyed and he might even end his life. Also the girl probably went to a night club and got &#34;raped&#34; by some chad while being intoxicated. TL;DR raping should be legal and saying no to an offer to have sex should be illegal. Because the counsequences are way worse. (120,126,2)

Most gamers are young men who are lonely so they resort to gaming because they are social outcast and do not have proper social interaction. This leads to them being the most rude and bigoted people that you could ever meet. The gaming community is based on the notion of Escaping The Real World. It is also based on becoming someone who you aren&#39;t. This let&#39;s young, angry men abuse attack and harass people of colour and women in particular. All of this abuse can be done anonymously.

[23:05:16]ADMIN: Infinitys true end/(Garret Schmidt) has created a command report: Spider-Man 3 is the best movie that Spider-Man made. Since its release in 2007, critics have spent countless hours analysing every frame, every scene, every line of dialogue in search of its many subdued themes and messages, like Garfield. Spider-Man 3 is a film about layers; on the surface, it's your typical thrill-a-minute Blockbuster with cutting-edge special effects, but upon further viewing your start to understand this is merely a faade

I thought she would enjoy a pickup line from one of the older books of the Bible, but I guess this church didn&#39;t seem to bother too much with the Old Testament. Told another woman &#39;&#39;For it being the Sabbath, you sure are working it!&#39;&#39; Turns out she was married and her husband got mad at me. I was too busy to check for a wedding band.

Yes, that&#39;s a Japanese phrase, I&#39;m learning Japanese from these videos. Before I get to the part about learning Japanese, though, let me first comment on the cultural implications of hentai. After the second world war, which Japan lost after the nuclear bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the entire country underwent a period of self-reflection and soul-searching. They wanted to understand how events led to the rest of the world responding with such devastating atomic attacks. This led to a strong antipathy towards war-mongering and international aggression. You may have heard about how the Japanese constitution doesn&#39;t allow the country to have an active military. Same idea. A lot of post-war Japanese culture is a reflection of such attitudes. For example, the Godzilla movies are not just about giant monsters fighting each other. They&#39;re about the horrors of unbridled ato (120,126,2)

When he turned five, he enrolled at Hamburger State University. There, he earned his bachelors degree in Lyrical Composition with a concentration in mumble rap. By six, he had mastered calculus and started writing PhD level academic papers. While he struggled a bit with integral calculus, he figured it out through dedication and hardwork over almost twenty-three minutes. In one of his papers, he addresses a mathematical application of music that transcends human logic, acting as the spark for his music career. But before he could start on his journey to musical stardom, he resolved to finish his PhD. By eight, his intellectual capacity had exceeded that of an average twenty-eight and a half year old. Realising his prodigious growth, Lil Pump thought he should spend some time in self reflection to get a better grasp on what he could expect of himself in future. So, he went to the Himalayas for 7 years (120,126,2)
