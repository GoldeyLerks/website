[15:32:41]ADMIN: LuigiBoiBY/(Kayla Moore) has created a command report: It was the last mission in my tour in Afghanistan (not that I knew that at the time,) I was manning a checkpoint in the middle of bumfuck nowhere when and gunfire erupted from all sides. Everybody scrambled to cover, except me. In the first barrage three bullets found their way into my leg, abdomen, and chest. I laid there on the ground dying. You might think I was scared, that I cried out for help or maybe I tried to crawl to safety, but as I laid there-bullets flying overhead and gunfire sounding off like a hundred drums- a feeling of peacefulness and clarity came over me. For maybe five more minutes I stayed on the ground. I had made peace with death, or so I thought. Just before my eyes closed for good, I had a realization. If I died here today, I would never be able to experience the wonder of anime tiddies ever again! I pushed my guts back into the hole that first bullet had made and crawled. And when I could no longer hear the gunfire I stood up and staggered. And when I could stagger no longer I crawled again. I crawled all the way back to base camp. The medics went to work on me right away. When I woke up they told me one bullet had grazed against my heart, and the other had ripped straight through one of my intestines. "Your survival was nothing less than a divine intervention," they said, "wounds like these would've killed anybody else, God must've been watching over you out there." But I knew that what saved me out there wasn't God, or luck, or karma, or any mystical force. What saved me out there was anime tiddies.

[15:34:08]ADMIN: LuigiBoiBY/(Kayla Moore) has created a command report: Have you ever wondered how modern Anime came to be? The animation, the choreography, the writing? It was all because of this. Cory in the House is one of the most successful Anime titles in the current decade. It surpasses Attack on Titan and other popular Anime titles. This is because Cory in the House was the founding father for all future Animes. The brilliant art direction is responsible for this masterpiece to earn several nominations as well as a Golden Globe. If you have yet to watch Cory in the House, I recommend you do so. I once worshiped Allah, but because of Cory in the House, I worship Cory now. I have made a shrine dedicated to loathing Cory. I perform dark rituals for my master. Everyday after the rituals, I sit down with all of my weaboo friends and we watch a good 3-4 hours of Cory in the House. I can not stress this enough that Cory in the House is one of the best Animes, wait no, one of the best series to ever air on television since the invention of televisions. Please, do it for Cory.
