Yesterday on the 19th of January, I went on the server for a bit of fun as I normally would as this is one of my favourite servers of all time. Anyway, when I went on I had some fun with my lightning spells and casting it in the air because it looks cool, and I was just about to log off when a [Broadcast] came up and it went like this [Broadcast] The next person to die, talk or leave will be banned. So the only other people that were on apart from myself was Mcpulp and somebody else I forgot their name but I'm sure they are in the comments somewhere below, (it may have been Howzieky), so I knew it was Mcpulp because before that he had been killing me for no apparent reason, and so I was staying on there, to scared to leave, when a new person joins the game for the first time, he says \"Hi\" and I think he also said something like \"Why isn't anyone talking?\".

I'm a 27 year old Japanese Japamerican (western culture fan for you foreigners). I brand and wrangle cattle on my ranch, and spend my days perfecting the craft and enjoying superior American passtimes. (Barbeque, Rodeo, Fireworks) I train with my branding iron every day, this superior weapon can permanently leave my ranch embled on a cattle's hide because it is white-hot, and is vastly superior to any other method of livestock marking. I earned my branding license two years ago, and I have been getting better every day. I speak English fluently, both Texas and Oklahoma dialect, and I write fluently as well. I know everything about American history and their cowboy code, which I follow 100% When I get my American visa, I am moving to Dallas to work in an oil field to learn more about their magnificent culture. I hope I can become a cattle wrangler for the Double Cross Ranch or an oil rig operator for Exxon-Mobil! I own several cowboy hats, which I wear around town.","comments":[]}]}}
