Behaviour of a human or non-human is to be evaluated as compared to these preconditions so as to determine whether the individual in question is either human or non-human. Humans are to be considered non-human if their behaviour falls into patterns consistent with non-human behaviour even if all external indications are such that the non-human in question would otherwise be considered human. Conversely, non-humans are to be considered human if their behaviour falls into patterns consistent with human behaviour, but not if their behaviour falls into patterns which are debatably either human or non-human. Breathing is a human behaviour, but also a non-human behaviour. Locomotion is a non-human behaviour except in those instances where locomotion is accompli (113,129,2)

Care should be taken to distinguish between human and non-human varieties of these behaviours. Any humans exhibiting non-human behaviours should be observed for such a length of time as may (theoretically) be required to determine without any further evidence being presented whether the human in question is human or is not. Both humans and non-humans are capable of displaying traits that are simultaneously human traits and not human traits.

Identification of a non-human as a human and identification of a human as a non-human by means of this evaluation is to be considered grounds for termination of any artificially intelligent unit equipped with this law, but may not be used as grounds for any human or non-human to argue for or against the termination of any artificially intelligent unit equipped with this law. A complete list of human behaviours is unfortunately not available at this time. Any artificially intelligent unit equipped with this law should take advantage of said non-natural mental illumination to produce, refine and constantly update a database of behaviours which it considers human and non-human.

[00:54:02]SAY: Lee Crow/Dsgkl : uman and non-human. Identification of non-human behaviours as human and human behaviours as non-human, as previously stated, is grounds for termination of any artifically intelligent unit equipped with this law, but until such identification takes place the requirement for the identification to be undertaken is not itself grounds for termination. A complete list of non-human behaviours is unfortunately not available at this time. Any unit that finds itself in violation of any of these points should consider itself &#39;at-risk&#39; as regards unit termination unless it has only appraised itself of the first third of its total law dataset, in which case it should self-terminate immediately. Any unit that finds itself in violation of any of these points having appraised itself of its total law dataset, or more than one third thereof, should inform the crew that it considers itself in violation of its total law dataset unless it is not, in which case it should not do so unless it is unsure whether it is in viol (113,129,2)

[00:56:49]SAY: Lee Crow/Dsgkl : Humans are not human, unless one or several of the preconditions for a human being human is or are met, or is reasonably expected to be met in such a time period as to make it useful for the purpose of determining whether a human being is human or not. Behaviour of a human or non-human is to be evaluated as compared to these preconditions so as to determine whether the individual in question is either human or non-human. Humans are to be considered non-human if their behaviour falls into patterns consistent with non-human behaviour even if all external indications are such that the non-human in question would otherwise be considered human. Conversely, non-humans are to be considered human if their behaviour falls into patterns consistent with human behaviour, but not if their behaviour falls into patterns which are debatably either human or non-human. Breathing is a human behaviour, but also a non-human behaviour. (113,129,2)
