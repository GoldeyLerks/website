## WARNING: There are 65 active turfs at roundstart, this is a mapping error caused by a difference of the air between the adjacent turfs. You can see its coordinates using "Mapping -> Show roundstart AT list" verb (debug verbs required)
## WARNING: HEY! LISTEN! 1 second were wasted processing 65 turf(s) (connected to 20565 other turfs) with atmos differences at round start.
