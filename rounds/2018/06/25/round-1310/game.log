A Centcom Official has been dispatched to your station, he is the highest ranking authority, for the duration of the shift, he has a store located where botany used to be, where you may browse and ask for certain narcotics, which he can retrieve with a Nanotrasen Uplink Implant. He is the only individual who may distribute narcotics to other crew.
